## Overview

This project requires the student to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.

## Project Requirements

The project requires the following:

-   Installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   API keys from the following web services:
    -   [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html)
    -   [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)
    -   [Weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/account/create)
-   Create .env file in the root directory;
-   Add the required API keys to the .env file

## Extra functionalities

For the "Extend your Project Further" part of the project, I have chosen the following extra functionalities:

-   Add end date and display length of trip.
-   Incorporate icons into forecast. (courtesy of Weatherbit)
-   Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.

## Running the App

Use command `npm install` to install necessary packages.
Use command `npm run prod` to run the app in production mode.
To run the app in development mode, use command `npm run start` to start the express server and `npm run dev` in a second terminal to run the app itself
